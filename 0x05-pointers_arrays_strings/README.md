This project involves the use of pointers and arrays and strings to solve and provide solutions for the problems below.

#0-reset_to_98.c
In this project, a function was created to point at the int variable and change the value of the variable by deferencing using the pointer.

#1-swap.c
in this project, the use of pointers to point to another pointer.

#2-strlen.c
in this project, a function that prints the exact amount of bytes the values used based on the data type of variable

#3-puts.c
in this project, a function that prints the string followed by a new line

#4-print_rev.c
in this project, a function that prints the string in reverse. to be able to do this, the lenght of the string had to be found so that a pointer can be assignedto the to enable printing backwards.

#5-rev_string.c
in this project, a function that prints the reverse of the array. to do this, the pointer has to point to the last element of the array then using variables to copy the values of the element using a loop

#6-puts2.c
in this project, a function that prints the string while skipping some other character(those that are not remainder of0 when divided by 2)

#7-puts_half.c
in this project, a function that prints the half the string by shifting the pointer to the center of the string and then using a loop to print with the end of line '\0' in mind.

#8-print_array.c
in this project, a function prints the elements of integers in an array followed by a new line

#9-strcpy.c
in this project, a function copies the string from src pointer(also acting as an array)
