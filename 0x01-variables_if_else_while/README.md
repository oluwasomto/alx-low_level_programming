This project is for variables and some loops.


#task 0: this task involves the completion of the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. hence to print the this we have to create an if statement because that is the way to print out the multiple outputs as stated in the requirements of the question.

#task 1: this task also like the task 0 requires the completion of the source code. using the if, if..else and else statements we were able to run the code. always remember that the else statement must end any if statement that if...else statement was involved.

#task 2: this required the use of a loop to automatically print the alphabets and the putchar function to read from standard input, i.e that is the loop and then displaying it to the standard output i.e the screen. Sometimes using the putchar function to insert a new line is "putchar('\n')" notice carefully the single quotes instead of the double quotes.

#task 3: this task involves printing out the alphabets using putchar function which prints out from standard input to the screen.

#task 4: this task involves the use of loop firstly to keep counting the letters, followed by an if statement totell the program to select of what should happen if this character is reached. then the 'continue' which is usedfor skipping the iteration or step in the code.

#task 5: this task involves the use of loop to automatically count the numbers, and the printf function to print the number. lastly the use of putchar('\n') to print a new line. Observe that at the end of the printf function, the \n period if inserted will grant a new line for each number printed, hence the \n was not attached to the printf function.

#task 6: this task is just like the above one. the difference is the only use of putchar to print the numbers.

#task 7: this task is just like the ones done above (see #task 2 for more information) but the difference is the result is in reverse form. the reverse form is due to the changes in the parameters in the for-loop.

#task 8: this task is just like #task 3. the difference is the change in parameters.
